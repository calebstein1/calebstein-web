# Welcome to Outer Space!

Wait that's not right... this is Caleb Stein's personal site.
Either way, I'm glad you're here!

I like to make cool software and web apps, check out the software page above to see what I've been working on lately.

My photography is also slowly but surely coming into the 21st century.
It was a big deal for me to move from film to digital photography (in mid 2023...), and for all of the drawbacks of digital photography (no chemicals, no hands-on process, too much instant gratification, etc.), if means I can have a photography page here more easily, so check it out.
